My Idea:
Runtime: 1832 ms, faster than 5.22% of Python3 online submissions for Validate Stack Sequences.
Memory Usage: 20.6 MB, less than 5.51% of Python3 online submissions for Validate Stack Sequences.

My method is not so good in performance (speed and memory). But it's able to handle cases that there
are duplicate values in pushed or poped list

For example: sample Input:
[1,2,3,2,5]
[5,2,3,2,1]


Other Solution:
