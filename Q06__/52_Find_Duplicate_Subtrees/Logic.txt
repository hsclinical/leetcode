My Idea:
combine all steps in instruction into start position/direction and end position/direction
case 1: start position and end position are both (0, 0).
  In this case, no matter how the end direction it it. It will return True
case 2: start position and end position are different.
  In this case, if the end direction is still 'N', it will go to infinity
  if it's 'S', it will go back to the original start after one more instruction input
  if it's 'E' or 'W', it will go back the original start after three more instruction inputs
