My Idea:
Use recursive method to test all possible combination. Use a dictionary to store previous results to
avoid re-calculation. A global variant is an alternative choice. Need go through all, instead of the
first after sorting coin from the largest to the smallest. For example: [1, 3, 4, 5] & 7. The result
should be 2 (4 and 3), instead of 3 (5, 1, 1)
