My Idea:
The difficulty is how to get the list that contains all combinations. The current version takes
partPath as a parameter to trace the path. If we can remove this parameter, therefore use lru_cache
may speed up the process

check prefix, if it's a palindrome. Cut and check the remaining using the recursive method

Other Solution:
