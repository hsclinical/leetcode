My Idea:
Load input List into Dictionary with start as key, end as value. If there are more than one input with
the same start, record the one with the largest end.
Sort Dictionary key from the smallest to the largest, then perform merging. There are three cases (since sorted by start)
1. No overlap
2. Partial overlap
3. The second is full covered by the first
