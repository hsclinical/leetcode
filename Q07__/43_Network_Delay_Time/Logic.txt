My Idea:
1. Initiate two dictionaries: one for confirmed nodes, the other for visited nodes
2. Start from the node given, add it to confirmed with score 0, add all neighbours of this node to visited and record distance
3. Find all nodes in visited with the lowest value. add the neighbours of those nodes into confirmed
4. Meanwhile, move those nodes from visited to confirmed.
5. Repeat process #3 and #4 until confirmed dictionary is empty
6. For loop range(n) to check if there is any node unconfirmed.
7. Output results
