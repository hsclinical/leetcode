My Idea:
1. Go through all intervals to find
  a. which interval fully cover the input interval
     Count number
  b. which interval is fully covered by the input interval
     Record start and end
  c. which interval overlap the input interval with smaller start
     Record end
  d. which interval overlap the input interval with larger start
     Record start

  If # in a >= threshold, return False, and exit
  Loop through start list for all intervals in (b, c, and d)
  Loop through end list for all intervals in (b, c, and d)

Advantage:
1. Good for any layer. In this case, it's 3. But this method is good for 4, 5 or more

Shortage:
1. Fail to use sorted list or dictionary

Note:
1. It's easy to update the current version to complete Q732 [Hard]

Other Solution:
Binary tree may be a better solution in BigO
