My Idea:
1. zip 3 lists (position, from, to) to create a new list
2. sort the list using position (reverse order), use lambda to indicate sort based on what
3. replace from the end to the start because the change at the end will not affect the index in the beginning.
   If replace from the beginning, it will be miserable
